# b2c5-strava

This is a simple Strava API client written in Python. It is designed to be used with the Strava API v3.

The intention of this project is to provide a simple way to interact with the Strava API. It is not intended to be a 
full-featured client, but rather a simple way to interact with the API.
It will be used to gather information about a user and their activities to recognize patterns and provide insights.
